# X-Team 03 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Vollenteer, then process of elemination for assign. Then if someone drops out of a task, 
someone else steps up and they switch tasks.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Check in through group me to make sure everyone completes their portion within a reasonable time. Create a spreadsheet on google docs to make sure everyone knows what they are responsible for completing. Weekly meetings if we are in the middle of a project to make sure everyone knows how to do what they are supposed to be doing.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will use a groupchat to communicate minor difficulties, and if a meeting in person is required for the task, we will use the groupchat to coordinate a meeting place / time.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Use Git to share code and have other team members contribute.
